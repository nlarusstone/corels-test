This folder contains code and data files for testing our data structures and algorithm

To compile the tests, simply run 'make tests' from the /src folder (not this folder), and then run './tests' to execute all the tests. If you wish to test only one part of the system, enter './tests [name]' where name is one of the following:

            Name                Description
    -   prefixmap       Test the prefix permutation map
    -   trie            Test the rulelist trie

For example, './tests [prefixmap]' would only run the tests for the prefix permutation map.
