\section{Data processing details and antecedent mining}
\label{appendix:data}

In this appendix, we provide details regarding datasets used in our experiments
(Section~\ref{sec:experiments}).

\subsection{ProPublica recidivism data set}
Table~\ref{tab:recidivism-data} shows the~6 attributes
and corresponding~17 categorical values
that we use for the ProPublica data set.
%
From these, we construct~17 single-clause antecedents, for example,
${(age = 23-25)}$.
%
We then combine pairs of these antecedents as conjunctions to form
two-clause antecedents, \eg ${(age = 23-25) \wedge (priors = 2-3)}$.
%
By virtue of our lower bound on antecedent support,
(Theorem~\ref{thm:min-capture},~\S\ref{sec:lb-support}),
we eliminate antecedents with support less than~0.005 or greater than~0.995,
since ${\Reg = 0.005}$ is the smallest regularization parameter value
we study for this problem.
%
With this filtering step, we generate between~121 and~123 antecedents for each fold;
without it, we would instead generate about~130 antecedents as input to our algorithm.

Note that we exclude the `current charge' attribute (which has two categorical values,
`misdemeanor' and `felony'); for individuals in the data set booked on multiple charges,
this attribute does not appear to consistently reflect the most serious charge.

\subsection{NYPD stop-and-frisk data set}
This data set is larger than, but similar to the NYCLU stop-and-frisk data set, 
described next.

%\newpage
\subsection{NYCLU stop-and-frisk data set}
The original data set contains 45,787 records,
each describing an incident involving a stopped person; the individual
was frisked in 30,345 (66.3\%) of records and and searched in 7,283 (15.9\%).
%
In 30,961 records, the individual was frisked and/or searched (67.6\%); of those,
a criminal possession of a weapon was identified 1,445 times (4.7\% of these records).
%
We remove 1,929 records with missing data, as well as a small number with extreme values
for the individual's age -- we eliminate those with age~${< 12}$ or~${>89}$.
%we also assume that one age marked `366' is a typo, and we replace it with `36'.
%
This yields a set of 29,595 records in which the individual was frisked and/or searched.
%
To address the class imbalance for this problem, we sample records from the
smaller class with replacement.
%
We generate cross-validation folds first, and then resample within each fold.
%
In our 10-fold cross-validation experiments, each training set contains 50,743 observations.
%
Table~\ref{tab:frisk-data} shows the 5 categorical attributes that we use,
corresponding to a total of 28 values.
%
Our experiments use these antecedents,
as well as negations of the 18 antecedents corresponding to the two features
\emph{stop reason} and \emph{additional circumstances},
which gives a total of 46 antecedents.

\section{Example optimal rule lists, for different values of~$\Reg$}
\label{appendix:examples}

For each of our prediction problems, we provide listings of
optimal rule lists found by CORELS, across 10 cross-validation folds,
for different values of the regularization parameter~$\Reg$.
%
These rule lists correspond to the results for CORELS summarized
in Figures~\ref{fig:sparsity-compas} and~\ref{fig:sparsity-weapon}~(\S\ref{sec:sparsity}).
%
Recall that as~$\Reg$ decreases, optimal rule lists tend to grow in length. \\

\subsection{ProPublica recidivism data set}
We show example optimal rule lists that predict two-year recidivism.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:recidivism-rule-list-02-01} shows examples for
regularization parameters~${\Reg = 0.02}$ and~0.01.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:recidivism-rule-list-005} shows examples for~${\Reg = 0.005}$;
Figure~\ref{fig:recidivism-all-folds}~(\S\ref{sec:examples}) showed two representative examples.

For the largest regularization parameter~${\Reg = 0.02}$~(Figure~\ref{fig:recidivism-rule-list-02-01}),
we observe that all folds identify the same length-1 rule list.
%
For the intermediate value~${\Reg = 0.01}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:recidivism-rule-list-02-01}),
the folds identify optimal 2-rule or 3-rule lists that contain the nearly same prefix rules,
up to permutations.
%
For the smallest value~${\Reg = 0.005}$~(Figure~\ref{fig:recidivism-rule-list-005}),
the folds identify optimal 3-rule or 4-rule lists that contain the nearly same prefix rules,
up to permutations.
%
Across all three regularization parameter values and all folds,
the prefix rules always predict the positive class label,
and the default rule always predicts the negative class label.
%
We note that our objective is not designed to enforce any of these properties.
%though some may be seen as desirable.

\subsection{NYCLU stop-and-frisk data set}
We show example optimal rule lists that predict whether a weapon

%
Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-rule-list-04-01} shows
regularization parameters~${\Reg = 0.04}$ and~0.01,
and Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-rule-list-0025} shows~${\Reg = 0.0025}$.
%
We showed a representative solution for~${\Reg = 0.01}$ in
Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-rule-list}~(\S\ref{sec:examples}).

For each of the two larger regularization parameters in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-rule-list-04-01},
${\Reg = 0.04}$~(top) and 0.01~(bottom), we observe that across the folds,
all the optimal rule lists contain the same or equivalent rules, up to a permutation.
%
With the smaller regularization parameter~${\Reg = 0.0025}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-rule-list-0025}),
we observe a greater diversity of longer optimal rule lists, though they share similar structure.

\section{Additional results on predictive performance and model size for
CORELS and other algorithms}
\label{appendix:cpw}

In this appendix, we plot TPR, FPR, and model size for CORELS and three other
algorithms, using the NYPD data set (Feature Set~D).

\caption{TPR (top) and FPR (bottom)
for the test set, as a function of model size, across different methods,
for weapon prediction with the NYPD stop-and-frisk data set (Feature Set~D).
%
In the legend, numbers in parentheses are algorithm parameters,
as in Figure~\ref{fig:sparsity-weapon}.
%
Legend markers and error bars indicate means and standard deviations,
respectively, across cross-validation folds.
%
%For CORELS and SBRL, we use ${M = 28}$ antecedents.
%
%CART with ${cp = 0.001}$ significantly overfits;
%C4.5 finds large models and dramatically overfits for all tested parameters.
C4.5 finds large models for all tested parameters.
