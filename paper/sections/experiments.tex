Our experimental analysis addresses four questions:
(1)~How does CORELS' accuracy and model size compare to that of other algorithms?
(2)~How rapidly do the objective value and its lower bound converge, for different values of~$\Reg$?
(3)~How much does each of the implementation optimizations contribute to CORELS' performance?
(4)~How rapidly does CORELS prune the search space?
We present additional empirical results and further implementation and data processing details
in a long version of this report~\citep{AngelinoLaAlSeRu17}.

All timed results ran on a server with two Intel Xeon E5-2699~v4
(55~MB cache, 2.20~GHz) processors and 756~GB RAM.
%
Except where we mention a memory constraint, all experiments
can run comfortably on smaller machines, \eg a laptop with 16GB~RAM.

We focus on two problems:
%using the ProPublica dataset~\citep{LarsonMaKiAn16} to predict two-year recidivism
%and using the NYCLU 2014 stop-and-frisk dataset~\citep{nyclu:2014} to predict
%whether a weapon will be found on a stopped individual who is frisked or searched.
(1)~Predicting which individuals in the ProPublica COMPAS dataset~\citep{LarsonMaKiAn16}
recidivate within two years (${N = 7,215}$).
Our rule mining procedure yields ${M = 156}$ single- and two-clause antecedents.
%
(2)~Using the NYCLU 2014 stop-and-frisk dataset~\citep{nyclu:2014}
to predict whether a weapon will be found on a stopped individual who is frisked or searched.
We identify a subset of 29,595 records for stopped individuals who were frisked and/or searched.
Of these, criminal possession of a weapon was identified in about 5\% of instances,
thus we resampled due to class imbalance.
In the first two subsections below, we use ${M =28}$ single-clause antecedents;
in the latter two, we add negations of some, yielding ${M =46}$.

\textit{Accuracy and model size:}
We first ran a 10-fold cross validation experiment using CORELS
and eight other algorithms:\footnote{We use standard R packages, with default
parameter settings, for the first seven.}
logistic regression, support vector machines, AdaBoost, CART, C4.5, random forests,
RIPPER,\footnote{We were unable to execute RIPPER for the NYCLU problem.}
and scalable Bayesian rule lists (SBRL).\footnote{Code for SBRL can be found at
\url{https://github.com/Hongyuy/sbrlmod}.}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:rule-list} shows an  optimal rule list that CORELS learns
for the ProPublica dataset.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:comparison} shows that there were no statistically significant
differences in algorithm accuracies --
the difference between folds was far larger than the difference between algorithms.
%
We conclude that CORELS produces models whose accuracy is comparable to those found via other algorithms.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:sparsity} summarizes differences in accuracy and model size
for CORELS and other tree (CART, C4.5) and rule list (RIPPER, SBRL) learning algorithms.
%
For both problems, CORELS can learn short rule lists without sacrificing accuracy.

\textit{Convergence and regularization:}
We illustrate several views of CORELS execution traces,
for the NYCLU stop-and-frisk dataset with ${M = 28}$ antecedents,
for the same three regularization parameters (${\Reg = 0.04}$, $0.01$, $0.025$)
as in Figure~\ref{fig:sparsity} (bottom).
%
The panels in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-reg-execution} plot example execution traces,
from a single cross-validation fold, of both the current best objective value~$\CurrentObj$
and the lower bound~$b(\Prefix, \x, \y)$ of the prefix~$\Prefix$ being evaluated.
%
These plots illustrate that CORELS certifies optimality
when the lower bound matches the objective value.
%
For each value of~$\Reg$, CORELS achieves the optimum in a small fraction of the total execution time.

Numbered points along the trace of the objective value
indicate when the length of the best known rule list changes
and are labeled by the new length.

and the time at which it was achieved.

%
Top: Objective value (thin lines) and lower bound (thick lines) for CORELS,

Bottom: $\lfloor \log_{10} \Remaining(\CurrentObj, \Queue) \rfloor$,
where~$\Remaining(\CurrentObj, \Queue)$
is the upper bound on remaining search space size

}
\label{fig:objective}
\end{figure}

As~$\Reg$ decreases, these times increase because the search problems become more difficult.
%
This is summarized by our observation that CORELS must evaluate longer prefixes:
across 10 cross-validation folds, the maximum evaluated prefix lengths are~6,
11, and~16 or~17, for ${\Reg = 0.04}$, $0.01$, and $0.025$, respectively.
%
As a consequence, our data structures grow in size: \eg
across 10 cross-validation folds, the mean number of queue elements are
1,900 (100), 170,000 (1,300), and 2,400,000 (170,000),
with standard deviations shown in parentheses,
for ${\Reg = 0.04}$, $0.01$, and $0.025$, respectively.


\textit{Algorithm optimizations:}
We determine the efficacy of each of our bounds and data structure optimizations.
%
In the remainder, we show results using the ProPublica dataset.
%
Table~\ref{tab:ablation} provides summary statistics for experiments using
the full CORELS implementation and variants that each remove a specific optimization.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:queue} presents a view of the same experiments, focusing
on three of our optimizations. These plots depict the number of
prefixes of a given length in the queue during the algorithm's execution.

The columns report total execution time,
time to optimum, number of queue insertions,
maximum queue size, and maximum evaluated prefix length.
%
The first row shows CORELS; subsequent rows show variants
that each remove a specific implementation optimization or bound.

We terminated each experiment in the last row once the size of the
trie reached ${10^9}$ nodes (each execution consumed $\sim$350GB RAM).
%
In all but the final row and column, we report means
(and standard deviations) over 10 cross-validation folds;

\textit{State space pruning:}
Figure~\ref{fig:objective} highlights the most significant
algorithm optimizations for our prediction problems,
using the ProPublica (left) and NYCLU (right) datasets.
%
On the left, for CORELS (solid lines),
the objective drops quickly, achieving the optimal value within 10~seconds.
%
CORELS certifies optimality in less than 6~minutes:
the objective lower bound steadily converges to the optimal objective (top)
as the search space shrinks (bottom).
%
In the same plots, we also show
a separate execution of CORELS without the equivalent points bound
(Theorem~\ref{thm:identical}) (dashes).
%
%After nearly 3~hours, this execution is still far from complete:
This execution is far from complete:
the lower bound is far from the optimum objective value (top)
and much of the search space remains unexplored (bottom).
%
On the right,
CORELS achieves the optimum objective in well under a second
and certifies optimality in less than a minute.
%
CORELS without the permutation bound (Corollary~\ref{thm:permutation}),
and thus the symmetry-aware map,
requires orders of magnitude more time to complete (dashes).
