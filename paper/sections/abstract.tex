We present the design and implementation of a custom discrete optimization technique for building rule lists that
are certifiably optimal over a categorical feature space.
%
By leveraging algorithmic bounds, efficient data structures, and computational
reuse,
we achieve several orders of magnitude speedup in time
and a massive reduction of memory consumption.
%
We demonstrate that our approach produces optimal rule lists on practical
problems in a matter of seconds.
%
This approach provides an alternative to CART and other decision tree methods.
