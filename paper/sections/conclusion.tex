\section{Conclusion}

CORELS is an efficient and accurate algorithm for constructing provably optimal rule lists.
%
Optimality is particularly important in domains where model interpretability
has social consequences, \eg recidivism prediction.
%
While achieving optimality on such discrete optimization problems is
computationally hard in general, we aggressively prune our problem's search space
via a suite of bounds.
%
This makes realistically sized problems tractable.
%
CORELS is amenable to parallelization, which should allow it to scale to
even larger problems.
