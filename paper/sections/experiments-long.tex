\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

Our experimental analysis addresses five questions:
%
How does CORELS' predictive performance compare to that of COMPAS scores
and other algorithms? (\S\ref{sec:compas}, \S\ref{sec:sparsity})
%
How does CORELS' model size compare to that of other algorithms? (\S\ref{sec:sparsity})
%
How rapidly do the objective value and its lower bound converge,
for different values of the regularization parameter~$\Reg$? (\S\ref{sec:reg-param})
%
How much does each of the implementation optimizations contribute to CORELS' performance?~(\S\ref{sec:ablation})
%
How rapidly does CORELS prune the search space? (\S\ref{sec:reg-param} and \S\ref{sec:ablation})
%
Before proceeding, we first describe our computational environment,
as well as the datasets we use and prediction problems for each,
and then show example optimal rule lists found by CORELS (\S\ref{sec:examples}).

\textbf{Computational environment.}
%\label{sec:environment}
All timed results ran on a server with an Intel Xeon E5-2699~v4 (55~MB cache, 2.20~GHz) processor and 264~GB RAM,
and we ran each timing measurement separately, on a single hardware thread, with nothing else running on the server.
%with two Intel Xeon E5-2699~v4 (55~MB cache, 2.20~GHz) processors and 756~GB RAM.
%
Except where we mention a memory constraint, all experiments
can run comfortably on smaller machines, \eg a laptop with 16~GB~RAM.

%\textbf{Datasets and prediction problems.}
%\label{sec:datasets}
Our evaluation focuses on two socially-important prediction problems associated
with recent, publicly-available datasets.

\textbf{Recicidivism prediction.}
For our first problem, we predict which individuals in the ProPublica COMPAS
dataset~\citep{LarsonMaKiAn16} recidivate within two years.
This dataset contains records for all offenders in Broward County, Florida
in 2013 and 2014 who were given a COMPAS score pre-trial.
Recidivism is defined as committing a crime within two years of the COMPAS
assessment.
%
From the original dataset of records for 7,214 individuals,
we identify a subset of 6,907 records without missing data.
%
For the majority of our analysis, we extract a set of~13 binary features (Feature Set~A),
which our antecedent mining framework combines into ${M=122}$ antecedents,
on average (folds ranged from containing 121 to 123 antecedents).
%
We also consider a second, similar antecedent set in~\S\ref{sec:examples},
derived from a superset of Feature set~A that includes~4 additional binary features (Feature Set~B).

\textbf{Weapon prediction.} For our second problem, we use New York City
stop-and-frisk data to predict whether a weapon will be found on a stopped
individual who is frisked or searched.
%
For experiments in [??FIXME??],
we compile data from a database maintained by the New York Police Department (NYPD)~\citep{nypd},
from years 2008-2012, following~\citet{Goel16}.
%
Starting from 2,941,390 records, each describing an incident involving
a stopped person, we first extract 376,488 records where the suspected
crime mentioned criminal possession of a weapon (CPW).
%('cpw' in c) or ('c.p.w.' in c)
%
From these, we next we identify a subset of 325,800 records for which the
individual was frisked and/or searched; of these, criminal possession of a weapon
was identified in only 10,885 instances (about 3.3\%).
%
Resampling due to class imbalance, for 10-fold cross-validation, yields training sets
that each contain 566,839 datapoints.
%
From a set of 5 categorical features, we form a set of [??FIXME??] single-clause antecedents
that we use as input to CORELS. [??FIXME?? actually we have 2 feature sets]

For experiments in [??FIXME??], we use a smaller stop-and-frisk dataset,
derived by the NYCLU from the NYPD's 2014 data~\citep{nyclu:2014}.
%
From the original dataset of 45,787 records, each describing an incident involving
a stopped person, we identify a subset of 29,595 records for which the individual
was frisked and/or searched.
%
Of these, criminal possession of a weapon was identified in only about 5\% of instances.
%
Resampling due to class imbalance, for 10-fold cross-validation, yields training sets
that each contain 50,743 datapoints.
%
From a set of 5 categorical features, we form a set of ${M=46}$ single-clause antecedents (including negations)
that we use in our experiments below.

For further details about these datasets, preprocessing steps, and antecedent mining,
see Appendix~\ref{appendix:data}.
%
Our choice of, and approach to, the weapon prediction problem is influenced by the work
of~\citet{Goel16}, who develop regression models to analyze racial disparities
in New York City's stop-and-frisk policy for a related, larger dataset.
%
In particular, the authors arrive at a simple and interpretable heuristic that
could potentially help police officers more effectively decide when to
frisk and/or search stopped individuals, \ie when such
interventions are likely to discover criminal possession of a weapon.

\subsection{Example optimal rule lists}
\label{sec:examples}

To motivate Feature Set~A, described in Appendix~\ref{appendix:data},
which we used in most of our analysis of the ProPublica dataset,
we first consider Feature Set~B, a larger superset of features.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:propublica} shows optimal rule lists learned by CORELS,
using Feature Set~B, which additionally includes race categories from the ProPublica dataset (African American, Caucasian, Hispanic,
Other\footnote{We grouped the original Native American ($<$0.003), Asian ($<$0.005), and Other ($<$0.06) categories.}).
%
For Feature Set~B, our antecedent mining procedure generated an average
of~189 antecedents, across folds.
%
None of the optimal rule lists contain antecedents that directly depend on race;
this motivated our choice to exclude race, by using Feature Set~A, in our subsequent analysis.
%
For both feature sets, we replaced the original ProPublica age categories ($<$25, 25-45, $>$45)
with a set that is more fine-grained for younger individuals (18-20, 21-22, 23-25, 26-45, $>$45).
%
Figures~\ref{fig:recidivism-all-folds} and~\ref{fig:weapon-rule-list}
show example optimal rule lists that CORELS learns
for the ProPublica (Feature Set~A, ${\Reg = 0.005}$) and NYCLU (${\Reg = 0.01}$) datasets, respectively,
using 10-fold cross validation.

While our goal is to provide illustrative examples, and not to provide a
detailed analysis nor to advocate for the use of these specific models,
we note that these rule lists are short and easy to understand.
%
For the examples and regularization parameter choices in this section,
the optimal rule lists are relatively robust across cross-validation folds:
the rules are nearly the same, up to permutations of the prefix rules.
%
For smaller values of the regularization parameter, we observe less robustness,
as rule lists are allowed to grow in length.
%
For the sets of optimal rule lists represented in Figures~\ref{fig:propublica},
\ref{fig:recidivism-all-folds}, and~\ref{fig:weapon-rule-list},
each set could be equivalently expressed as a DNF rule;
\eg this is easy to see when the prefix rules all predict the positive class label
and the default rule predicts the negative class label.
%
Our objective is not designed to enforce any of these properties,
though some may be seen as desirable.
%
Finally, we note that the three-rule list for weapon prediction
in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-rule-list} has the spirit of the heuristic
strategy presented by~\citet{Goel16} that combines three stop criteria
and is based on a reduced version of their full regression~model.

As we demonstrate in~\S\ref{sec:sparsity},
optimal rule lists learned by CORELS achieve accuracies that are competitive
with a suite of other models, including black box COMPAS scores.
%
See Appendix~\ref{appendix:examples} for additional listings of optimal rule lists found
by CORELS, for each of our prediction problems, across cross-validation folds,
for different regularization parameters~$\Reg$.

\subsection{Comparison of CORELS to the black box COMPAS algorithm}
\label{sec:compas}

The accuracies of rule lists learned by CORELS are competitive with
scores generated by the black box COMPAS algorithm
at predicting two-year recidivism for the ProPublica dataset.
%
Across 10 cross-validation folds, optimal rule lists learned by CORELS
(Figure~\ref{fig:recidivism-all-folds}, ${\Reg = 0.005}$)
have a mean test accuracy of~0.665, with standard deviation~0.018.
%
The COMPAS algorithm outputs scores between~1 and~10,
representing low~(1-4), medium~(5-7), and high~(8-10) risk for recidivism.
%
As in the analysis by~\citep{LarsonMaKiAn16}, we interpret a medium or high score
as a positive prediction for two-year recidivism, and a low score as a negative prediction.
%
Across the 10 test sets, the COMPAS algorithm scores obtain
a mean accuracy of~0.660, with standard deviation~0.019.

%In addition, we observe that CORELS achieves a lower false positive rate (FPR) on black individuals than COMPAS does across all 10 folds.
%
%While CORELS also has a lower true positive rate (TPR) on black individuals than COMPAS, the two algorithms perform similarly on white individuals.
%
%Both algorithms have much higher FPRs and TPRs on black individuals than white individuals.
%
%Since the rule lists output by CORELS do not explicitly contain race, the rules involving prior criminal convictions must implicitly be racially skewed.
%
%Although CORELS is less likely to predict a false positive for black individuals in this case, our primary advantage comes from the fact that our model can be easily inspected to determine why the prediction rates are different across races (or any other category).

\caption{Comparison of TPR and FPR (left), as well as TNR and FNR (right),
for different races in the ProPublica dataset, for CORELS and COMPAS,

%
%CORELS has a lower FPR for black individuals in the dataset than COMPAS, as well as a lower TPR.
%
%Both CORELS and COMPAS have a significantly higher FPR rate for black indviduals than white individuals--despite CORELS producing optimal rule lists without explicit race features.
%
}
\label{fig:tpr-fpr}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:tpr-fpr} shows that CORELS and COMPAS perform similarly across both black and white individuals.
%
Both algorithms have much higher true positive rates (TPR's) and false positive rates (FPRs) for blacks than whites (left), and higher true negative rates (TNR's) and false negative rates (FNRs) for whites than blacks (right).
%
The fact that COMPAS has higher FPR's for blacks and higher FNR's for whites was a central observation motivating ProPublica's claim that COMPAS is racially biased~\citep{LarsonMaKiAn16}.
%
The fact that CORELS' models are so simple, with almost the same results as COMPAS, and do not contain anything except criminal history features and age, indicates possible explanations for the uneven predictions of both COMPAS and CORELS.
%
In particular, blacks tend to have longer criminal histories within the dataset,
(on average, 4.4 crimes for blacks versus~2.6 crimes for whites)
leading to higher FPR's for blacks and higher FNR's for whites.
%
This aspect of the data could entirely explain why ProPublica concluded that COMPAS was racially biased.
%
There are many definitions of fairness, and it is not clear whether CORELS's models are fair either, but it is much easier to debate about the fairness of a model when it is transparent.
%
Additional fairness constraints or transparency constraints can be placed on CORELS' models if desired, though one would need to edit our bounds~(\S\ref{sec:framework}) and implementation~(\S\ref{sec:implementation}) in order to impose more constraints.

Regardless of whether COMPAS is racially biased (which our analysis does not indicate is true as long as criminal history and age are allowed to be considered as features),
COMPAS may have many other fairness defects that might be considered serious.
%
Many of COMPAS's survey questions are direct inquiries about socioeconomic status. For instance, COMPAS asks:
``Is it easy to get drugs in your neighborhood?,''
``How often do you have barely enough money to get by?,''
``Do you frequently get jobs that don't pay more than minimum wage?,''
``How often have you moved in the last~12 months?''
%
COMPAS's survey questions also ask about events that were not caused by the person who is being evaluated, such as:
``If you lived with both parents and they later separated, how old were you at the time?,''
``Was one of you parents ever sent to jail or prison?,''
``Was your mother ever arrested, that you know of?"
\citep{compas-survey:2016,AngwinLaMaKi16}.

The fact that COMPAS requires over~130 questions to be answered, many of whose answers may not be verifiable, means that the computation of the COMPAS score is prone to errors.
%
Even the Arnold Foundation's ``public-safety assessment'' (PSA) score -- which is completely transparent, and has only~9 factors -- has been miscalculated in serious criminal trials, leading to a recent lawsuit~\citep{npr-bail:2017}.
%
It is substantially more difficult to obtain the information required to calculate COMPAS scores than PSA scores (with over~14 times the number of survey questions).
%
This significant discrepancy suggests that COMPAS scores are more fallible than PSA scores, as well as even simpler models, like those produced by CORELS.
%
Some of these problems could be alleviated by using only data within electronic records that can be automatically calculated, instead of using information entered by hand and/or collected via subjective surveys.

The United States government pays Northpointe (now called equivant) to use COMPAS.
%
In light of our observations that CORELS is as accurate as COMPAS on a real-world dataset where COMPAS is used in practice, CORELS predicts similarly to COMPAS for both blacks and whites, and CORELS' models are completely transparent, it is not clear what value COMPAS scores possess.
%
Our experiments also indicate that the proprietary survey data required to compute COMPAS scores has not boosted its prediction accuracy above that of transparent models in practice.

Risk predictions are important for the integrity of the judicial system; judges cannot be expected to keep entire databases in their heads to calculate risks, whereas models (when used correctly) can help to ensure equity.
%
Risk prediction models also have the potential to heavily impact how efficient the judicial system is, in terms of bail and parole decisions; efficiency in this case means that dangerous individuals are not released, whereas non-dangerous individuals are granted bail or parole.
%
High stakes decisions, such as these, are ideal applications for machine learning algorithms that produce transparent models from high dimensional data.

Currently, justice system data does not support highly accurate risk predictions, but current risk models are useful in practice, and these risk predictions will become more accurate as more data and higher quality data are made available.

\subsection{Predictive performance and model size for CORELS and other algorithms}
\label{sec:sparsity}

We ran a 10-fold cross validation experiment using CORELS
and eight other algorithms:
logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), AdaBoost, CART, C4.5,
random forest (RF), RIPPER, and scalable Bayesian rule lists (SBRL).\footnote{For
SBRL, we use the C implementation at \url{https://github.com/Hongyuy/sbrlmod}.
By default, SBRL sets ${\eta = 3}$, ${\lambda = 9}$,
the number of chains to 11 and iterations to 1,000.}
%
We use standard R packages, with default parameter settings,
for the first seven algorithms.\footnote{For CART, C4.5 (J48), and RIPPER,
we use the R packages rpart, RWeka, and caret, respectively.
%
By default, CART uses complexity parameter ${cp = 0.01}$ and C4.5 uses complexity parameter ${C = 0.25}$.
}
%
We use the same antecedent sets as input to the two rule list learning algorithms, CORELS and SBRL;
for the other algorithms, the inputs are binary feature sets corresponding to the
single clause antecedents in the aforementioned antecedent sets (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:data}).

Figure~\ref{fig:compas-comparison} shows that for the ProPublica dataset,
there were no statistically significant differences in test accuracies across algorithms;
the difference between folds was far larger than the difference between algorithms.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-comparison} shows that for the NYCLU dataset,
the TPR's across algorithms are similar, while FPR's show more variation;
we show TPR and FPR due to class imbalance.
%
For this problem, CORELS obtains a TPR that is statistically close to the best performing algorithms,
while achieving a significantly lower FPR.
%
We conclude that CORELS produces models whose predictive performance is comparable to or better than
those found via other algorithms.

Figures~\ref{fig:sparsity-compas} and~\ref{fig:sparsity-weapon} summarize differences
in predictive performance and model size
for CORELS and other tree (CART, C4.5) and rule list (RIPPER, SBRL) learning algorithms.
%
Here, we vary different algorithm parameters, and increase the number of iterations for SBRL to 10,000.
%
For two-year recidivism prediction with the ProPublica dataset (Figure~\ref{fig:sparsity-compas}),
we plot both training and test accuracy,
as a function of the number of leaves in the learned model.
%
Due to class imbalance for the weapon prediction problem with the NYCLU stop-and-frisk dataset
(Figure~\ref{fig:sparsity-weapon}), we plot both true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR),
again as a function of the number of leaves.
%
For both problems, CORELS can learn short rule lists without sacrificing predictive performance.
%
For listings of example optimal rule lists that correspond to the results
for CORELS summarized here, see Appendix~\ref{appendix:examples}.

Table~\ref{tab:weapon-reg} summarizes execution traces across all 10 cross-validation folds.
%
For each value of~$\Reg$, CORELS achieves the optimum in a small fraction of the total execution time.
%
As~$\Reg$ decreases, these times increase because the search problems become more difficult,
as is summarized by the observation that CORELS must evaluate longer prefixes;
consequently, our data structures grow in size.
%
We report the total number of elements inserted into the queue and the maximum queue size;
recall from~\S\ref{sec:implementation} that the queue elements correspond to the trie's leaves,
and that the symmetry-aware map elements correspond to the trie's nodes.

The upper panels in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-reg-execution} plot example execution traces,
from a single cross-validation fold, of both the current best objective value~$\CurrentObj$

%
These plots illustrate that CORELS certifies optimality
when the lower bound matches the objective value.
%
The lower panels in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-reg-execution} plot corresponding traces of
an upper bound on the size of the remaining search space (Theorem~\ref{thm:remaining-eval-fine}),
and illustrate that as~$\Reg$ decreases, it becomes more difficult to eliminate regions of the search~space.
%
For Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-reg-execution}, we dynamically and incrementally
calculate~$\lfloor \log_{10} \Remaining(\CurrentObj, \Queue) \rfloor$,
which adds some computational overhead; we do not calculate this elsewhere unless noted.

Figure~\ref{fig:queue-weapon-reg} visualizes the elements in CORELS's logical queue,
for each of the executions in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-reg-execution}.
%
Recall from~\S\ref{sec:gc} that the logical queue corresponds to elements in the
(physical) queue that have not been garbage collected from the trie; these are prefixes that
CORELS has already evaluated and whose children the algorithm plans to evaluate next.
%
As an execution progresses, longer prefixes are placed in the queue;
as~$\Reg$ decreases, the algorithm must spend more time evaluating longer and longer prefixes.

This section examines the efficacy of each of our bounds and data structure optimizations.
%
We remove a single bound or data structure optimization from our final implementation and measure
how the performance of our algorithm changes.
%
We examine these performance traces on both the NYCLU and the ProPublica datasets,
and highlight the result that on different problems, the relative performance improvements
of our optimizations can vary.

Table~\ref{tab:ablation} provides summary statistics for experiments using the full

%
(1)~Instead of a priority queue (\S\ref{sec:queue}) ordered by the objective lower bound,
we use a queue that implements breadth-first search (BFS).
%
(2)~We remove checks that would trigger pruning via
our lower bounds on antecedent support (Theorem~\ref{thm:min-capture})
and accurate antecedent support (Theorem~\ref{thm:min-capture-correct}).
%
(3)~We remove the effect of our lookahead bound (Lemma~\ref{lemma:lookahead}),
which otherwise tightens the objective lower bound by an amount equal to the regularization parameter~$\Reg$.
%
(4)~We disable the symmetry-aware map (\S\ref{sec:pmap}), our data structure
that enables pruning triggered by the permutation bound (Corollary~\ref{thm:permutation}).
%
(5)~We do not identify sets of equivalent points, which we otherwise use to tighten the
objective lower bound via the equivalent points bound (Theorem~\ref{thm:identical}).

Removing any single optimization increases total execution time,
by varying amounts across these optimizations.
%
Similar to our experiments in~\S\ref{sec:reg-param}, we always encounter the
optimal rule list in far less time than it takes to certify optimality.
%
As in Table~\ref{tab:weapon-reg}, we report metrics that are all proxies
for how much computational work our algorithm must perform;
these metrics thus scale with the overall slowdown with respect to CORELS execution time
(Table~\ref{tab:ablation}, first column).

Figure~\ref{fig:queue} visualizes execution traces of the elements in CORELS's logical queue,
similar to Figure~\ref{fig:queue-weapon-reg},
for a single, representative cross-validation fold.
%
Panels correspond to different removed optimizations, as in Table~\ref{tab:ablation}.
%
These plots demonstrate that our optimizations reduce the number of evaluated prefixes
and are especially effective at limiting the number of longer evaluated prefixes.
%
For the ProPublica dataset, the most important optimization is the equivalent points
bound---without it, we place prefixes of at least length~10 in our queue,
and must terminate these executions before they are complete.
%
In contrast, CORELS and most other variants evaluate only prefixes up to at most length~5,
except for the variant without the lookahead bound, which evaluates prefixes up to length~6.

Table~\ref{tab:ablation-weapon} and Figure~\ref{fig:queue-weapon} summarize an
analogous set of experiments for the NYCLU dataset.
%
Note that while the equivalent points bound proved to be the most important optimization for the ProPublica dataset,
the symmetry-aware map is the crucial optimization for the NYCLU dataset.

(Theorem~\ref{thm:remaining-eval-fine}).
%

CORELS to quickly eliminate most of the search space (thin solid lines);

Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:objective} highlights the most significant
algorithm optimizations for our prediction problems:
the equivalent points bound for the ProPublica dataset (left)
and the symmetry-aware map for the NYCLU dataset (right).
%
For CORELS (thin lines) with the ProPublica recidivism dataset (left),
the objective drops quickly, achieving the optimal value within a second.
CORELS certifies optimality in about a minute---the objective lower bound
steadily converges to the optimal objective (top) as the search space shrinks (bottom).
%
As in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-reg-execution}, we dynamically and incrementally
calculate~$\lfloor \log_{10} \Remaining(\CurrentObj, \Queue) \rfloor$,
where~$\Remaining(\CurrentObj, \Queue)$
is the upper bound~\eqref{eq:remaining} on remaining search space size
(Theorem~\ref{thm:remaining-eval-fine}); this adds some computational overhead.
%
In the same plots (left), we additionally highlight
a separate execution of CORELS without the equivalent points bound
(Theorem~\ref{thm:identical}) (thick lines).
%
After more than 2 hours, the execution is still far from complete;
in particular, the lower bound is far from the optimum objective value (top)
and much of the search space remains unexplored~(bottom).
%
For the NYCLU stop-and-frisk dataset (right),
CORELS achieves the optimum objective in well under a second,
and certifies optimality in a little over a minute.
%
CORELS without the permutation bound (Corollary~\ref{thm:permutation}),
and thus the symmetry-aware map,
requires more than an hour, \ie orders of magnitude more time, to complete (thick lines).

\end{tabular}
\caption{Algorithmic speedup for the ProPublica dataset (${\Reg = 0.005}$, ${M = 122}$).
%
Solving this problem using brute force is impractical due to the inability to explore rule lists of reasonable lengths.
%
Removing only the equivalent points bound requires exploring prefixes of up to length 10 (see Table \ref{tab:ablation}), a clearly intractable problem.
%
Even with all of our improvements, however, it is only recently that processors have been fast enough in order to allow this type of discrete optimization algorithm to succeed.
}
\vspace{4mm}
\label{tab:speedup}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:speedup} shows the overall speedup of CORELS compared to a na\"ive implementation
and demonstrates the infeasibility of running our algorithm 30 years ago.
%
Consider an execution of CORELS for the ProPublica dataset, with ${M = 122}$ antecedents,
that evaluates prefixes up to length~5 in order to certify optimality (Table~\ref{tab:ablation}).
%
A brute force implementation that na\"ively considers all prefixes of up to length~5
would evaluate ${2.5 \times 10^{10}}$ prefixes.
%
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:recidivism-all-folds}, the optimal rule list has prefix length~3,
thus the brute force algorithm would identify the optimal rule list.
%
However, for this approach to certify optimality, it would have consider far longer prefixes.
%
Without our equivalent points bound, but with all of our other optimizations,
we evaluate prefixes up to at least length~10
(see Table~\ref{tab:ablation} and Figure~\ref{fig:queue})---thus a brute force algorithm
would have to evaluate prefixes of length~10 or longer.
%
Na\"ively evaluating all prefixes up to length~10 would require looking at ${5.0 \times 10^{20}}$ different prefixes.

However, CORELS examines only 28 million prefixes in total---a reduction of 893 compared to examining
all prefixes up to length~5 and a reduction of ${1.8 \times 10^{13}}$ for the case of length~10.
%
On a laptop, we require about 1.3~$\mu$s to evaluate a single prefix (given by dividing the number of lower bound evaluations by the total time
in Table~\ref{tab:ablation}). 
%
Our runtime is only about 36 seconds, but the na\"ive solutions of examining all prefixes up to
lengths~5 and~10 would take 9 hours and 21 million years, respectively.
%
It is clear that brute force would not scale to larger problems.

We compare our current computing circumstances to those of 1984, the year when CART was published.
%
Moore's law holds that computing power doubled every 18 months from 1984--2006.
%
This is a period of 264 months, which means computing power has gone up by at least a factor of 32,000 since 1984.
%
Thus, even with our algorithmic and data structural improvements,
CORELS would have required over 1.2 million seconds in 1984---an unreasonable amount of time.
%
Our advances are meaningful only because we can run them on a modern system.
%
Combining our algorithmic improvements with the increase in modern processor speeds,
our algorithm runs more than $10^{13}$ times faster than a na\"ive implementation would have in 1984.
%
This helps explain why neither our algorithm, nor other branch-and-bound variants, had been developed before now.
