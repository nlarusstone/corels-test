\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

Our experimental analysis addresses five questions:
%
How does CORELS' accuracy compare to that of other algorithms,
including COMPAS scores? (\S\ref{sec:sparsity})
%
How does CORELS' model size compare to that of other algorithms? (\S\ref{sec:sparsity})
%
How rapidly do the objective value and its lower bound converge,
for different values of the regularization parameter~$\Reg$? (\S\ref{sec:reg-param})
%
How much does each of the implementation optimizations contribute to CORELS' performance?~(\S\ref{sec:ablation})
%
How rapidly does CORELS prune the search space? (\S\ref{sec:reg-param} and \S\ref{sec:ablation})
%
Before proceeding, we first describe our computational environment,
as well as the datasets we use and prediction problems for each,
and then show example optimal rule lists found by CORELS (\S\ref{sec:examples}).

\textbf{Computational environment.}
%\label{sec:environment}
All timed results ran on a server with an Intel Xeon E5-2699~v4 (55~MB cache, 2.20~GHz) processor and 264~GB RAM,
and we ran each timing measurement separately, on a single hardware thread, with nothing else running on the server.
%with two Intel Xeon E5-2699~v4 (55~MB cache, 2.20~GHz) processors and 756~GB RAM.
%
Except where we mention a memory constraint, all experiments
can run comfortably on smaller machines, \eg a laptop with 16~GB~RAM.

%\textbf{Datasets and prediction problems.}
%\label{sec:datasets}
Our evaluation focuses on two socially-important prediction problems associated
with recent, publicly-available datasets.

\textbf{ProPublica recidivism dataset.}
For our first problem, we predict which individuals in the ProPublica COMPAS
dataset~\citep{LarsonMaKiAn16} recidivate within two years.
This dataset contains records for all offenders in Broward County, Florida
in 2013 and 2014 who were given a COMPAS score pre-trial.
Recidivism is defined as committing a crime within two years of the COMPAS
assessment.
%
From the original dataset of records for 7,214 individuals,
we identify a subset of 6,907 records without missing data.
%
For the majority of our analysis, we extract a set of~13 binary features (Feature Set~A),
which our antecedent mining framework combines into ${M=122}$ antecedents,
on average (folds ranged from containing 121 to 123 antecedents).
%
We also consider a second, similar antecedent set in~\S\ref{sec:examples},
derived from a superset of Feature set~A that includes~4 additional binary features (Feature Set~B).

\textbf{NYCLU stop-and-frisk dataset.} For our second problem, we use
the NYCLU 2014 stop-and-frisk dataset~\citep{nyclu:2014} to predict
whether a weapon will be found on a stopped individual who is frisked or searched.
%
From the original dataset of 45,787 records, each describing an incident involving
a stopped person, we identify a subset of 29,595 records for which the individual
was frisked and/or searched.
%
Of these, criminal possession of a weapon was identified in only about 5\% of instances.
%
Resampling due to class imbalance, for 10-fold cross-validation, yields training sets
that each contain 50,743 datapoints.
%
From a set of 5 categorical features, we form a set of ${M=46}$ single-clause antecedents (including negations)
that we use in our experiments below.

For further details about these datasets, preprocessing steps, and antecedent mining,
see Appendix~\ref{appendix:data}.
%
Our choice of, and approach to, the weapon prediction problem is inspired by the work
of~\citet{Goel16}, who develop regression models to analyze racial disparities
in New York City's stop-and-frisk policy for a related, larger dataset.
%
In particular, the authors arrive at a simple and interpretable heuristic that
could potentially help police officers more effectively decide when to
frisk and/or search stopped individuals, \ie when such
interventions are likely to discover criminal possession of a weapon.

\subsection{Example optimal rule lists}
\label{sec:examples}

To motivate Feature Set~A, described in Appendix~\ref{appendix:data},
which we used in most of our analysis of the ProPublica dataset,
we first consider Feature Set~B, a larger superset of features.

\label{fig:weapon-rule-list}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:propublica} shows optimal rule lists learned by CORELS,
using Feature Set~B, which additionally includes race categories from the ProPublica dataset (African American, Caucasian, Hispanic,
Other\footnote{We grouped the original Native American ($<$0.003), Asian ($<$0.005), and Other ($<$0.06) categories.}).
%
For Feature Set~B, our antecedent mining procedure generated an average
of~189 antecedents, across folds.
%
None of the optimal rule lists contain antecedents that directly depend on race;
this motivated our choice to exclude race, by using Feature Set~A, in our subsequent analysis.
%
For both feature sets, we replaced the original ProPublica age categories ($<$25, 25-45, $>$45)
with a set that is more fine-grained for younger individuals (18-20, 21-22, 23-25, 26-45, $>$45).
%
Figures~\ref{fig:recidivism-all-folds} and~\ref{fig:weapon-rule-list}
show example optimal rule lists that CORELS learns
for the ProPublica (Feature Set~A, ${\Reg = 0.005}$) and NYCLU (${\Reg = 0.01}$) datasets, respectively,
using 10-fold cross validation.

While our goal is to provide illustrative examples, and not to provide a
detailed analysis nor to advocate for the use of these specific models,
we note that these rule lists are short and easy to understand.
%
For the examples and regularization parameter choices in this section,
the optimal rule lists are robust across cross-validation folds:
the rules are the same, up to a permutation of the prefix rules.
%
Also, the prefix rules always predict the positive class label
and the default rule always predicts the negative class label;
thus, each of these rule lists could be equivalently expressed as a DNF rule.
%
Our objective is not designed to enforce any of these properties,
though some may be seen as desirable.
%
We also note that the three-rule list for weapon prediction
in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-rule-list} has the spirit of the heuristic
strategy presented by~\citet{Goel16} that combines three stop criteria
and is based on a reduced version of their full regression model.
%
As we demonstrate in~\S\ref{sec:sparsity},
optimal rule lists learned by CORELS achieve accuracies that are competitive
with a suite of other models, including black box COMPAS scores.
%
See Appendix~\ref{appendix:examples} for additional listings of optimal rule lists found
by CORELS, for each of our prediction problems, across cross-validation folds,
for different values of the regularization parameter~$\Reg$.

\subsection{Comparison of accuracy and model size for CORELS and other algorithms}
\label{sec:sparsity}

We ran a 10-fold cross validation experiment using CORELS
and eight other algorithms:
logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), AdaBoost, CART, C4.5,
random forest (RF), RIPPER, and scalable Bayesian rule lists (SBRL).\footnote{For
SBRL, we use the C implementation at \url{https://github.com/Hongyuy/sbrlmod}.
By default, SBRL sets ${\eta = 3}$, ${\lambda = 9}$,
the number of chains to 11 and iterations to 1,000.}
%
We use standard R packages, with default parameter settings,
for the first seven algorithms.\footnote{For CART, C4.5 (J48), and RIPPER,
we use the R packages rpart, RWeka, and caret, respectively.
%
By default, CART uses complexity parameter ${cp = 0.01}$ and C4.5 uses complexity parameter ${C = 0.25}$.
}
%
We use the same antecedent sets as input to the two rule list learning algorithms, CORELS and SBRL;
for the other algorithms, the inputs are binary feature sets corresponding to the
single clause antecedents in the aforementioned antecedent sets (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:data}).

Figure~\ref{fig:comparison} shows that for the ProPublica dataset (left),
there were no statistically significant differences in test accuracies across algorithms;
the difference between folds was far larger than the difference between algorithms.
%
For the NYCLU dataset (right), the differences between algorithms are more significant,
with CART, random forests, and CORELS performing the best.
%
We conclude that CORELS produces models whose accuracy is comparable to or better than
those found via other algorithms.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:sparsity} summarizes differences in accuracy and model size
for CORELS and other tree (CART, C4.5) and rule list (RIPPER, SBRL) learning algorithms.
%
Here, we vary different algorithm parameters, and increase the number of iterations for SBRL to 10,000.
%
For both problems, CORELS can learn short rule lists without sacrificing accuracy.
%
For listings of example optimal rule lists that correspond to the results
for CORELS summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:sparsity}, see Appendix~\ref{appendix:examples}.

\textbf{Comparison to COMPAS.}
The accuracies of rule lists learned by CORELS are competitive with
scores generated by the black box COMPAS algorithm
at predicting two-year recidivism for the ProPublica dataset.
%
Across 10 cross-validation folds, optimal rule lists learned by CORELS
(Figure~\ref{fig:recidivism-all-folds}, ${\Reg = 0.005}$)
have a mean test accuracy of~0.665, with standard deviation~0.018.
%
The COMPAS algorithm outputs scores between~1 and~10,
representing low (1-4), medium (5-7), and high (8-10) risk for recidivism.
%
As in the analysis by~\citep{LarsonMaKiAn16}, we interpret a medium or high score
as a positive prediction for two-year recidivism, and a low score as a negative prediction.
%
Across the 10 test sets, the COMPAS algorithm scores obtain
a mean accuracy of~0.660, with standard deviation~0.019.

In addition, we observe that CORELS achieves a lower false positive rate (FPR) on black individuals than COMPAS does across all 10 folds.
%
While CORELS also has a lower true positive rate (TPR) on black individuals than COMPAS, the two algorithms perform similarly on white individuals.
%
Both algorithms have much higher FPRs and TPRs on black individuals than white individuals.
%
Since the rule lists output by CORELS do not explicitly contain race, the rules involving prior criminal convictions must implicitly be racially skewed.
%
Although CORELS is less likely to predict a false positive for black individuals in this case, our primary advantage comes from the fact that our model can be easily inspected to determine why the prediction rates are different across races (or any other category).

CORELS and COMPAS perform similarly across both black and white individuals.
%
Both algorithms have much higher FPRs and TPRs for blacks than whites, and higher true negative rates (TNRs) and false negative rates (FNRs) for whites than blacks. 
%
The fact that COMPAS has higher FPR's for blacks and higher FNR's for whites was a central observation motivating Propublica's claim that COMPAS is racially biased. 
%
The fact that CORELS' models are so simple, with almost the same results as COMPAS, and do not contain anything except criminal history features and age, indicates possible explanations for the uneven predictions of both COMPAS and CORELS. 
%
In particular, blacks tend to have longer criminal histories (on average 4.4 crimes for blacks vs 2.6 crimes for whites), leading to higher FPR's and lower FNR's for blacks.
%
There are many definitions of fairness, and it is not clear whether these models are fair, but it is much easier to debate about the fairness of a model when it is transparent. 
%
Additional fairness constraints or transparency constraints can be placed on CORELS' models if desired, though one would need to edit the bounds and code in order to impose more constraints.

COMPAS is a proprietary model, constructed from a proprietary dataset involving surveys that are not available in any form. 
%
The US government pays Northpointe (now called Equivant) to use COMPAS.
%
In light of the fact that CORELS is as accurate as COMPAS, CORELS' models are completely transparent, and CORELS predicts similarly to COMPAS for both blacks and whites, it is not clear what the value of using COMPAS is. 
%
Further, our experiments indicate that the proprietary survey data required to compute COMPAS does not have value, as it does not increase prediction accuracy.

\subsection{CORELS execution traces, for different regularization parameters}
\label{sec:reg-param}
In this section, we illustrate several views of CORELS execution traces,
for the NYCLU stop-and-frisk dataset with ${M = 46}$ antecedents,
for the same three regularization parameters (${\Reg = .04, .01, .025}$)
as in Figure~\ref{fig:sparsity} (bottom).

Table~\ref{tab:weapon-reg} summarizes execution traces across all 10 cross-validation folds.
%
For each value of~$\Reg$, CORELS achieves the optimum in a small fraction of the total execution time.
%
As~$\Reg$ decreases, these times increase because the search problems become more difficult,
as is summarized by the observation that CORELS must evaluate longer prefixes;
as a consequence, our data structures grow in size.
%
We report the total number of elements inserted into the queue and the maximum queue size;
recall from~\S\ref{sec:implementation} that the queue elements correspond to the trie's leaves,
and that the symmetry-aware map elements correspond to the trie's nodes.

The upper panels in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-reg-execution} plot example execution traces,
from a single cross-validation fold, of both the current best objective value~$\CurrentObj$
and the lower bound~$b(\Prefix, \x, \y)$ of the prefix~$\Prefix$ being evaluated.
%
These plots illustrate that CORELS certifies optimality
when the lower bound matches the objective value.
%
The lower panels in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-reg-execution} plot corresponding traces of
an upper bound on the size of the remaining search space (Theorem~\ref{thm:remaining-eval-fine}),
and illustrate that as~$\Reg$ decreases, it becomes more difficult to eliminate regions of the search~space.
%
For Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-reg-execution}, we dynamically and incrementally
calculate~$\lfloor \log_{10} \Remaining(\CurrentObj, \Queue) \rfloor$,
which adds some computational overhead; we do not perform this calculation elsewhere unless noted.

Figure~\ref{fig:queue-weapon-reg} visualizes the elements in CORELS's logical queue,
for each of the executions in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-reg-execution}.
%
Recall from~\S\ref{sec:gc} that the logical queue corresponds to elements in the
(physical) queue that have not been garbage collected from the trie; these are prefixes that
CORELS has already evaluated and whose children the algorithm plans to evaluate next.
%
As an execution progresses, longer prefixes are placed in the queue;
as~$\Reg$ decreases, the algorithm must spend more time evaluating longer and longer prefixes.

\subsection{Efficacy of CORELS algorithm optimizations}
\label{sec:ablation}

This section examines the efficacy of each of our bounds and data structure optimizations.
%
We remove a single bound or data structure optimization from our final implementation and measure
how the performance of our algorithm changes.
%
We examine these performance traces on both the NYCLU and the ProPublica datasets,
and highlight the result that on different problems, the relative performance improvements
of our optimizations can vary.

Table~\ref{tab:ablation} provides summary statistics for experiments using the full
CORELS implementation and five variants that each remove a specific optimization.
%
(1)~Instead of a priority queue (\S\ref{sec:queue}) ordered by the objective lower bound,
we use a queue that implements breadth-first search (BFS).
%
(2)~We remove checks that would trigger pruning via
our lower bounds on antecedent support (Theorem~\ref{thm:min-capture})
and accurate antecedent support (Theorem~\ref{thm:min-capture-correct}).
%
(3)~We remove the effect of our lookahead bound (Lemma~\ref{lemma:lookahead}),
which otherwise tightens the objective lower bound by~$\Reg$.
%
(4)~We disable the symmetry-aware map (\S\ref{sec:pmap}), our data structure
that enables pruning triggered by the permutation bound (Corollary~\ref{thm:permutation}).
%
(5)~We do not identify sets of equivalent points, which we otherwise use to tighten the
objective lower bound via the equivalent points bound (Theorem~\ref{thm:identical}).

Removing any single optimization increases total execution time,
by varying amounts across these optimizations.
%
Similar to our experiments in~\S\ref{sec:reg-param}, we always encounter the
optimal rule list in far less time than it takes to certify optimality.
%
As in Table~\ref{tab:weapon-reg}, we report metrics that are all proxies
for how much work our algorithm has to do, and thus scale with the overall slowdown.

Figure~\ref{fig:queue} visualizes execution traces of the elements in CORELS's logical queue,
similar to Figure~\ref{fig:queue-weapon-reg},
for a single, representative cross-validation fold.
%
Panels correspond to different removed optimizations, as in Table~\ref{tab:ablation}.
%
These plots demonstrate that our optimizations reduce the number of evaluated prefixes
and are especially effective at limiting the number of longer evaluated prefixes.
%
For the ProPublica dataset, the most important optimization is the equivalent points
bound---without it, we place prefixes of at least length~9 in our queue,
and must terminate these executions before they are complete.
%
In contrast, CORELS, and variants that remove any single one of the other
optimizations evaluate only prefixes up to at most length~7 (without the lookahead bound)
or~6 (all other variants).

Table~\ref{tab:ablation-weapon} and Figure~\ref{fig:queue-weapon} summarize an
analogous set of experiments for the NYCLU dataset.
%
Note that while the equivalent points bound proved to be the most important optimization for the ProPublica dataset,
the symmetry-aware map is the crucial optimization for the NYCLU dataset.

Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:objective} highlights the most significant
algorithm optimizations for our prediction problems:
the equivalent points bound for the ProPublica dataset (left)
and the symmetry-aware map for the NYCLU dataset (right).
%
For CORELS (thin lines) with the ProPublica recidivism dataset (left),
the objective drops quickly, achieving the optimal value within 10 seconds.
CORELS certifies optimality in less than 6 minutes --
the objective lower bound steadily converges to the optimal objective (top)
as the search space shrinks (bottom).
%
As in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-reg-execution}, we dynamically and incrementally
calculate~$\lfloor \log_{10} \Remaining(\CurrentObj, \Queue) \rfloor$,
where~$\Remaining(\CurrentObj, \Queue)$
is the upper bound~\eqref{eq:remaining} on remaining search space size
(Theorem~\ref{thm:remaining-eval-fine}); this adds some computational overhead.
%
In the same plots (left), we additionally highlight
a separate execution of CORELS without the equivalent points bound
(Theorem~\ref{thm:identical}) (thick lines).
%
After nearly 3 hours, the execution is still far from complete;
in particular, the lower bound is far from the optimum objective value (top)
and much of the search space remains unexplored (bottom).
%
For the NYCLU stop-and-frisk dataset (right),
CORELS achieves the optimum objective in well under a second,
and certifies optimality in less than a minute.
%
CORELS without the permutation bound (Corollary~\ref{thm:permutation}),
and thus the symmetry-aware map,
requires orders of magnitude more time to complete (thick lines).

%
Numbered points along the trace of the objective value
indicate when the length of the best known rule list changes,
and are labeled by the new length.
%
CORELS quickly achieves the optimal value (star markers),
and certifies optimality when the lower bound matches the objective value.
%
On the left, a separate and significantly longer execution of CORELS
without the equivalent points  (Theorem~\ref{thm:identical}) bound remains
far from complete, and its lower bound (thick solid line) far from the optimum.
%
On the right, a separate execution of CORELS without the permutation bound
(Corollary~\ref{thm:permutation}), and thus the symmetry-aware map,
requires orders of magnitude more time to complete.
%
Bottom: $\lfloor \log_{10} \Remaining(\CurrentObj, \Queue) \rfloor$,
as a function of wall clock time (log scale),
where~$\Remaining(\CurrentObj, \Queue)$
is the upper bound~\eqref{eq:remaining} on remaining search space size
(Theorem~\ref{thm:remaining-eval-fine}).
%
For these problems, the equivalent points (left) and
permutation (right) bounds are responsible for the ability of
CORELS to quickly eliminate most of the search space (thin solid lines);
the remaining search space decays much more slowly without these bounds (thick solid lines).

\subsection{Algorithmic Speedup}
%
Table \ref{tab:speedup} shows the overall speed-up of CORELS compared to a naive implementation and demonstrates the infeasibility of running
our algorithm 30 years ago.
%
Consider an execution of CORELS for the ProPublica dataset, with ${M = 122}$ antecedents,
that evaluates prefixes up to length~5 in order to certify optimality (Table~\ref{tab:ablation}).
%
A brute force implementation that naively considers all prefixes of up to length~5
would evaluate ${2.5 \times 10^{10}}$ prefixes.
%
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:recidivism-all-folds}, the optimal rule list has prefix length~4,
thus the brute force algorithm would identify the optimal rule list.
%
However, for this approach certify optimality, it would have consider far longer prefixes.
%
Without our equivalent points bound, but with all of our other optimizations,
we evaluate prefixes up to at least length 10
(see Table~\ref{tab:ablation} and Figure~\ref{fig:queue})---thus a brute force algorithm
would have to evaluate prefixes of length 10 or longer.
%
Naively evaluating all prefixes up to length 10 would require looking at $5.0 \times 10^{20}$ different prefixes.
%
However, CORELS examines only 28 million prefixes in total---a reduction of 893 compared to examining all prefixes up to length 5 and a reduction of $1.8 \times 10^{13}$ for the case of length 10.
%
On a laptop, we require about 1.3μs to evaluate a single prefix (given by dividing the number of lower bound evaluations by the total time
in Table~\ref{tab:ablation}). 
%
Our runtime is only about 36 seconds, but the naive solutions of examining all prefixes up to lengths 5 and 10 would take 9 hours and 21 million years, respectively. 
%
It is clear that brute force would not scale to larger problems.

We compare our current computing circumstances to those of 1984, the year when CART was published.
%
Moore's law holds that computing power doubled every 18 months from 1984-2006.
%
This is a period of 264 months, which means computing power has gone up by at least a factor of $32,000$ since 1984.
%
Thus, even with our algorithmic and data structural improvements, CORELS would have run in over 1,200,000s in 1984---an unreasonable amount of time.
%
Our advances are meaningful only because we can run them on a modern system.
%
Combining our algorithmic improvements with the increase in modern processor speeds, our algorithm runs more than $10^{13}$ times faster than a naive implementation would have in 1984.
%
This helps explain why our algorithm, nor other branch-and-bound variants, had not been developed before now.

\begin{table}[]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
& Maximum & Number of & Predicted runtime \\
& prefix length & evaluated prefixes & \\ \hline
Our approach & 5  & $ 2.8 \times 10^7$ & $36.4$ sec             \\ \hline
Brute Force & 5 & $2.5 \times 10^{10}$ & $3.3 \times 10^4$ sec = $9.0$ hours           \\ \hline
Brute Force & 10 & $5.0 \times 10^{20}$ & $6.5 \times 10^{14}$ sec = $21$ million years          \\ \hline
Our approach (1984) & 5 & $2.8 \times 10^7$ & $1.2 \times 10^6$ sec = $13.5$ days          \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Algorithmic Speedup for ProPublica dataset (${\Reg = 0.005}$, ${M = 122}$).
%
Solving this problem using brute force is intractable due to the inability to explore rule lists of any reasonable length.
%
Removing just the equivalent points bound, we explore prefixes of up to length 10 (see Table \ref{tab:ablation}), a clearly intractable problem.
%
Even with all of our improvements, however, it is only recently that processors have been fast enough in order to allow this type of discrete optimization algorithm to succeed.
