\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

Our experimental analysis addresses five questions:
(1) How does CORELS' accuracy compare to other algorithms?
(2) How does CORELS' model size compare to other algorithms?
(3) How rapidly does the objective function converge?
(4) How rapidly does CORELS prune the search space?
(5) How much does each of the implementation optimizations contribute to CORELS' performance?

\subsection{Computational environment}

All results that we present were executed on a server with two Intel Xeon E5-2699~v4
(55~MB cache, 2.20~GHz) processors and 448~GB RAM.
%
Except where we mention a memory constraint, all experiments
can run comfortably on smaller machines, \eg a laptop with 16GB~RAM.

\subsection{Datasets and prediction problems}

Our evaluation focuses on two socially-important prediction problems associated
with recent, publicly-available datasets:
\begin{itemize}
\item Predicting which individuals in the ProPublica COMPAS
dataset~\citep{LarsonMaKiAn16} recidivate within two years.
This dataset contains records for all offenders in Broward County, Florida
in 2013 and 2014 who were given a COMPAS score pre-trial.
Recidivism is defined as committing a crime within 2 years of the COMPAS
assessment.
This dataset contains records for 7,215 individuals.
%
Our rule mining framework extracts 14 features and combines them into
156 antecedents on average (folds ranged from containing 155 to 157 antecedents).
%
\item Using the NYCLU 2014 stop-and-frisk dataset~\citep{nyclu:2014} to predict
whether a weapon will be found on a stopped individual who is frisked or searched.
%
From the original dataset of 45,787 records, each describing an incident involving
a stopped person, we identify a subset of 29,595 records for which the individual
was frisked and/or searched.
%
Of these, criminal possession of a weapon was identified in only about 5\% of instances.
%
Resampling due to class imbalance, for 10-fold cross-validation, yields training sets
that each contain 50,743 datapoints.
%
From a set of 5 categorical features, we form a set of~28 single-clause antecedents
that we use in our experiments below, through~\S\ref{sec:sparsity}.
%
For our experiments in~\S\ref{sec:traces}, we add negations of 18 of these antecedents,
which gives a total of 46 antecedents.
\end{itemize}
%
For further details about data preprocessing steps and antecedent mining,
see Appendix~\ref{appendix:data}.
%
Our choice of and approach to the weapon prediction problem is inspired by the work
of~\citet{Goel16}, who develop regression models to analyze racial disparities
in New York City's stop-and-frisk policy, for a similar, larger dataset.
%
In particular, the authors arrive at a simple and interpretable heuristic that
could potentially help police officers more effectively decide when to
frisk and/or search stopped individuals, \ie when such
interventions are likely to discover criminal possession of a weapon.

\subsection{Example rule lists}
\label{sec:examples}

We first ran a 10-fold cross validation experiment using CORELS
and eight other algorithms:
logistic regression, support vector machines, AdaBoost, CART, C4.5,
random forests, RIPPER, and scalable Bayesian rule lists (SBRL).~\footnote{For
SBRL, we use the C implementation at \url{https://github.com/Hongyuy/sbrlmod}.}
%
We use standard R packages, with default parameter settings,
for the first seven algorithms.~\footnote{For CART, C4.5 (J48), and RIPPER,
\ie the tree and rule list learning algorithms, we use the implementations
from the R packages rpart, RWeka, and caret, respectively.
%
By default, CART uses complexity parameter ${cp = 0.01}$,
and C4.5 uses complexity parameter ${C = 0.25}$.

%
The most common of these was found by 6 folds (top),
the next was found by 2 folds (middle), and the last by 1 fold (bottom).
%
We observe that all of these rule lists start with the same rule,
end with the same default rule, and contain the same prefix rules, up to a permutation;
the prefix rules always predict the positive class label,
and the default rule always predicts the negative class label.
%
Note that our objective is not designed to enforce any of these properties,
though some may be seen as desirable.

\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:recidivism-all-folds} and~\ref{fig:weapon-rule-list}
show example optimal rule lists that CORELS learns
for the ProPublica and NYCLU datasets, respectively.
%
While our goal is to provide illustrative examples, and not to provide a
detailed analysis nor to advocate for the use of these specific models,
we note that these rule lists are short and easy to understand.
%
In particular, the three-rule list for weapon prediction
in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-rule-list} has the spirit of the heuristic
strategy presented by~\citet{Goel16} that combines three stop criteria
and is based on a reduced version of their full regression model.
%
See Appendix~\ref{appendix:examples} for listings of optimal rule lists found
by CORELS, for each of our prediction problems, across cross-validation folds,
for different values of the regularization parameter~$\Reg$.

\subsection{Comparison of accuracy and model size for CORELS and other algorithms}
\label{sec:sparsity}

Figure~\ref{fig:comparison} shows that there were no statistically significant
differences in algorithm accuracies.
In fact, the difference between folds was far larger than the difference
between algorithms.
We conclude that CORELS produces models whose accuracy is comparable
to those found via other algorithms.

%
Note that the CART implementation sets ${cp = 0.01}$ by default,

\label{fig:sparsity}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:sparsity} summarizes differences in accuracy and model size
for CORELS and other tree (CART, C4.5) and rule list (RIPPER, SBRL) learning algorithms.
%
For both problems, CORELS can learn short rule lists without sacrificing accuracy.
%

for CORELS summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:sparsity}, see Appendix~\ref{appendix:examples}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Efficacy of CORELS algorithm optimizations}
\label{sec:traces}

We determine the efficacy of each of our bounds and data structure optimizations.
%
Table~\ref{tab:ablation} provides summary statistics for experiments using the full
CORELS implementation and five variants that each remove a specific optimization.
%
The time to optimum column marks the first time we encounter the optimal rule list, 
which is much smaller than the time it takes to certify optimality.
%
The max evaluated prefix length column displays the longest prefix placed in the queue
as well as the longest prefix considered, which is always one more due to our incremental
computation.
%
Due to our regularization constant, the longest prefix CORELS places in its queue is
5 while an implementation without just the equivalent points bound looks at prefixes of over
length 10.
%
The number of lower bound evaluations is a proxy for the number of prefixes we examine in the 
course of execution.
%
This number tracks quite well with the overall time and we can calculate how long it takes to 
evaluate each prefix by taking the ratio of the number of lower bound evaluations and the time.
%
Finally, the table tracks the total number of insertions in our queue and the maximum size of our queue.
%
The maximum queue size is a large fraction of the total number of elements we add to the queue, but is 
only a small part of the total number of prefixes we evaluate.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:queue} presents a view of the same experiments.
%
These plots depict the number of prefixes of a given length in the queue
during the algorithm's execution.
%
Note that the gray area in Figure~\ref{fig:queue} is equivalent to the max queue size column for
CORELS in Table~\ref{tab:ablation}.

Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:objective} highlights the most significant
algorithm optimizations for our prediction problems,
using the ProPublica (left) and NYCLU (right) datasets.
%
For CORELS (solid lines) with the ProPublica recidivism dataset (left),
the objective drops quickly, achieving the optimal value within 10 seconds.
CORELS certifies optimality in less than 6 minutes --
the objective lower bound of the remaining search space
steadily converges to the optimal objective as the search space shrinks.
%
In the same plots (left), we additionally highlight a separate execution of CORELS
without the equivalent points bound (Theorem~\ref{thm:identical}) (dark blue dashed lines).
%
After nearly 3 hours, the execution is still far from complete;
in particular, the lower bound is far from the optimum objective value (top)
and much of the search space remains (bottom).
%
For the NYCLU stop-and-frisk dataset (right),
CORELS achieves the optimum objective in well under a second,
and certifies optimality in less than a minute.
%
CORELS without the permutation bound (Corollary~\ref{thm:permutation}),
and thus the symmetry-aware map, requires orders of magnitude more time to complete
(cyan dashed lines).

%
On the left, a separate and significantly longer execution of CORELS
without the equivalent points  (Theorem~\ref{thm:identical}) bound remains
far from complete, and its lower bound (dashed line) far from the optimum.

CORELS to quickly eliminate most of the search space (solid line);
the remaining search space decays much more slowly without this bound (dashed line).

our algorithm 30 years ago.

On the COMPAS dataset, where the number of rules is $M = 156$, naively evaluating all prefixes of up to length 5 would
require examining $8.7 \times 10^{10}$ different prefixes.
%
However, while CORELS only examines prefixes up to length 5 in order to certify optimality, a naive implementation 
would have to look at even longer prefixes. 
%
Without our equivalent points bound, but with all of our other optimizations, we evaluate prefixes up to at least length 10 (see 
Table~\ref{tab:ablation} and Figure~\ref{fig:queue})---thus a naive algorithm would have to evaluate prefixes of length 10 or longer.
%
Naively evaluating all prefixes up to length 10 would require looking at $6.4 \times 10^{21}$ different prefixes.
%
However, CORELS examines only 180 million prefixes in total---a reduction of $3.5 \times 10^{13}$.
%
It takes us about 2$\mu$s to evaluate a single prefix (given by dividing the number of lower bound evaluations by the total time
in Table~\ref{tab:ablation}).
%
A naive solution would take $1.54 \times 10^8$ seconds---about 5 years---while CORELS takes only 2 minutes.
%
It is clear that brute force would not scale to larger problems.
%

We compare our current computing circumstances to those of 1984, the year when CART was published.
%
Moore's law holds that computing power doubled every 18 months from 1984-2006.
%
This is a period of 264 months, which means computing power has gone up by at least a factor of $32,000$ since 1984.
%
Thus, even with our algorithmic and data structural improvements, CORELS would have run in over 3,600,000s in 1984---an unreasonable amount of time.
%
Our advances are only meaningful because we can run them on a modern system.
%
Combining our algorithmic improvements with the increase in modern processor speeds, our algorithm runs more than $10^{18}$ times faster than a naive implementation would have in 1984.
%
This helps explain why our algorithm, nor other branch-and-bound variants, had not been developed before now.
