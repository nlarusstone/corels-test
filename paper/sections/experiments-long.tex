\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

Our experimental analysis addresses five questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item How does CORELS' accuracy compare to that of other algorithms? (\S\ref{sec:sparsity})
\item How does CORELS' model size compare to that of other algorithms? (\S\ref{sec:sparsity})
\item How rapidly do the objective value and its lower bound converge,
for different values of the regularization parameter~$\Reg$? (\S\ref{sec:reg-param})
\item How much does each of the implementation optimizations contribute to CORELS' performance? (\S\ref{sec:ablation})
\item How rapidly does CORELS prune the search space? (\S\ref{sec:reg-param} and \S\ref{sec:ablation})
\end{itemize}
Below, we first describe our computational environment (\S\ref{sec:environment}),
datasets we use and prediction problems for each (\S\ref{sec:datasets}),
and example optimal rule lists found by CORELS (\S\ref{sec:examples}).

\subsection{Computational environment}
\label{sec:environment}

All timed results ran on a server with two Intel Xeon E5-2699~v4
(55~MB cache, 2.20~GHz) processors and 756~GB RAM.
%
Except where we mention a memory constraint, all experiments
can run comfortably on smaller machines, \eg a laptop with 16GB~RAM.

\subsection{Datasets and prediction problems}
\label{sec:datasets}

Our evaluation focuses on two socially-important prediction problems associated
with recent, publicly-available datasets:
\begin{itemize}
\item Predicting which individuals in the ProPublica COMPAS
dataset~\citep{LarsonMaKiAn16} recidivate within two years.
This dataset contains records for all offenders in Broward County, Florida
in 2013 and 2014 who were given a COMPAS score pre-trial.
Recidivism is defined as committing a crime within 2 years of the COMPAS
assessment.
This dataset contains records for 7,215 individuals.
%
Our rule mining framework extracts 14 features and combines them into
${M=156}$ antecedents on average (folds ranged from containing 155 to 157 antecedents).
%
\item Using the NYCLU 2014 stop-and-frisk dataset~\citep{nyclu:2014} to predict
whether a weapon will be found on a stopped individual who is frisked or searched.
%
From the original dataset of 45,787 records, each describing an incident involving
a stopped person, we identify a subset of 29,595 records for which the individual
was frisked and/or searched.
%
Of these, criminal possession of a weapon was identified in only about 5\% of instances.
%
Resampling due to class imbalance, for 10-fold cross-validation, yields training sets
that each contain 50,743 datapoints.
%
From a set of 5 categorical features, we form a set of ${M=28}$ single-clause antecedents
that we use in our experiments below, through~\S\ref{sec:sparsity}.
%
For our experiments in~\S\ref{sec:ablation}, we add negations of 18 of these antecedents,
which gives a total of ${M=46}$ antecedents.
\end{itemize}
%
For further details about data preprocessing steps and antecedent mining,
see Appendix~\ref{appendix:data}.
%
Our choice of, and approach to, the weapon prediction problem is inspired by the work
of~\citet{Goel16}, who develop regression models to analyze racial disparities
in New York City's stop-and-frisk policy for a similar, but larger, dataset.
%
In particular, the authors arrive at a simple and interpretable heuristic that
could potentially help police officers more effectively decide when to
frisk and/or search stopped individuals, \ie when such
interventions are likely to discover criminal possession of a weapon.

\subsection{Example optimal rule lists}
\label{sec:examples}

We first ran a 10-fold cross validation experiment using CORELS
and eight other algorithms:
logistic regression, support vector machines, AdaBoost, CART, C4.5,
random forests, RIPPER, and scalable Bayesian rule lists (SBRL).\footnote{For
SBRL, we use the C implementation at \url{https://github.com/Hongyuy/sbrlmod}.
By default, SBRL sets ${\eta = 3}$, ${\lambda = 9}$,
the number of chains to 11 and iterations to 1,000.}
%
We use standard R packages, with default parameter settings,
for the first seven algorithms.\footnote{For CART, C4.5 (J48), and RIPPER,
\ie the tree and rule list learning algorithms, we use the implementations
from the R packages rpart, RWeka, and caret, respectively.
%
By default, CART uses complexity parameter ${cp = 0.01}$,
and C4.5 uses complexity parameter ${C = 0.25}$.

%
The most common of these was found by 6 folds (top),
the next was found by 2 folds (middle), and the last by 1 fold (bottom).
%
We observe that all of these rule lists start with the same rule,
end with the same default rule, and contain the same prefix rules, up to a permutation;
the prefix rules always predict the positive class label,
and the default rule always predicts the negative class label.
%
Thus, these rule lists could be equivalently expressed as a DNF rule.
%
Note that our objective is not designed to enforce any of these properties,
though some may be seen as desirable.

\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:recidivism-all-folds} and~\ref{fig:weapon-rule-list}
show example optimal rule lists that CORELS learns
for the ProPublica and NYCLU datasets, respectively.
%
While our goal is to provide illustrative examples, and not to provide a
detailed analysis nor to advocate for the use of these specific models,
we note that these rule lists are short and easy to understand.
%
In particular, the three-rule list for weapon prediction
in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-rule-list} has the spirit of the heuristic
strategy presented by~\citet{Goel16} that combines three stop criteria
and is based on a reduced version of their full regression model.
%
See Appendix~\ref{appendix:examples} for listings of optimal rule lists found
by CORELS, for each of our prediction problems, across cross-validation folds,
for different values of the regularization parameter~$\Reg$.

\subsection{Comparison of accuracy and model size for CORELS and other algorithms}
\label{sec:sparsity}

Figure~\ref{fig:comparison} shows that there were no statistically significant
differences in algorithm accuracies.
In fact, the difference between folds was far larger than the difference
between algorithms.
We conclude that CORELS produces models whose accuracy is comparable
to those found via other algorithms.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:sparsity} summarizes differences in accuracy and model size
for CORELS and other tree (CART, C4.5) and rule list (RIPPER, SBRL) learning algorithms.
%
For both problems, CORELS can learn short rule lists without sacrificing accuracy.
%

for CORELS summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:sparsity}, see Appendix~\ref{appendix:examples}.

\subsection{CORELS execution traces, for different regularization parameters}
\label{sec:reg-param}

In this section, we illustrate several views of CORELS execution traces,
for the NYCLU stop-and-frisk dataset with ${M = 28}$ antecedents,
for the same three regularization parameters (${\Reg = 0.04, 0.01, 0.025}$)
as in Figure~\ref{fig:sparsity} (bottom).

Table~\ref{tab:weapon-reg} summarizes execution traces across all 10 cross-validation folds.
%
For each value of~$\Reg$, CORELS achieves the optimum in a small fraction of the total execution time.
%
As~$\Reg$ decreases, these times increase because the search problems become more difficult,
as is summarized by the observation that CORELS must evaluate longer prefixes;
as a consequence, our data structures grow in size.
%
We report the total number of elements inserted into the queue and the maximum queue size;
recall from~\S\ref{sec:implementation} that the queue elements correspond to the trie's leaves,
and that the symmetry-aware map elements correspond to the trie's nodes.

The upper panels in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-reg-execution} plot example execution traces,
from a single cross-validation fold, of both the current best objective value~$\CurrentObj$
and the lower bound~$b(\Prefix, \x, \y)$ of the prefix~$\Prefix$ being evaluated.
%
These plots illustrate that CORELS certifies optimality
when the lower bound matches the objective value.
%
The lower panels in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-reg-execution} plot corresponding traces of
an upper bound on the size of the remaining search space (Theorem~\ref{thm:remaining-eval-fine}),
and illustrate that as~$\Reg$ decreases, it becomes more difficult to eliminate regions of the search space.

Figure~\ref{fig:queue-weapon-reg} visualizes the elements in CORELS's logical queue,
for each of the executions in Figure~\ref{fig:weapon-reg-execution}.
%
Recall from~\S\ref{sec:gc} that the logical queue corresponds to elements in the
(physical) queue that have not been garbage collected from the trie; these are prefixes that
CORELS has already evaluated and whose children the algorithm plans to evaluate next.
%
As an execution progresses, longer prefixes are placed in the queue;
as~$\Reg$ decreases, the algorithm must spend more time evaluating longer and longer prefixes.

\subsection{Efficacy of CORELS algorithm optimizations}
\label{sec:ablation}

This section examines the efficacy of each of our bounds and data structure optimizations.
%
We remove a single bound or data structure optimization from our final implementation and measure
how the performance of our algorithm changes.
%
We examine these performance traces on both the NYCLU and the ProPublica datasets and show that
different bounds are important depending on the structure of the dataset.

Table~\ref{tab:ablation} provides summary statistics for experiments using the full
CORELS implementation and five variants that each remove a specific optimization.
%
Each experiment was run under 10-fold cross validation---each entry in the table is the mean from those 
runs while the standard deviation is reported in parentheses. 
%
Not all components are equally important; as each component is removed the run time of the algorithm increases,
but it increases by different amounts.
%
However, we can see that, similar to Table~\ref{tab:weapon-reg}, we always encounter the optimal rule list in far less
time than it takes to certify optimality.
%
We again note the longest prefix we place on the queue as well as the longest prefix for which we evaluate the bounds.
%
Finally, we report the number of prefixes evaluated, the number of times we insert into the queue, and the maximum size
of the logical queue.
%
Since these metrics are all proxies for how much work our algorithm has to do, they all scale with the overall slowdown 
of our algorithm.

Figure~\ref{fig:queue} records the execution trace of the 10-fold cross validation experiments detailed in Table~\ref{tab:ablation}.
%
Panels correspond to different removed optimizations as seen in the table; each color represents a different prefix length,
so the entire plot shows the number of prefixes of different lengths over the entire execution of the program.
%
The gray area in each plot represents the cumulative number of prefixes in our queue at any given time during the mean execution
of CORELS.
%
These plots demonstrate that our optimizations reduce the number of prefixes examined and are especially effective at 
limiting the number of long prefixes that have to be evaluated.
%
For the ProPublica dataset, the most important optimization is the equivalent points bound---without it we place prefixes of 
length 9 in our queue, while every other optimization prevents looking at prefixes of at worst length 6.

Similarly, Figure~\ref{fig:queue-weapon} provides a trace of the experiments from Table~\ref{tab:ablation-weapon} dealing with the NYCLU dataset.
%
Note that while the equivalent points bound proved to be the most important optimization for the ProPublica dataset,
the symmetry-aware map is the crucial optimization for the NYCLU dataset.

Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:objective} highlights the most significant
algorithm optimizations for our prediction problems:
the equivalent points bound for the ProPublica dataset (left)
and the symmetry-aware map for the NYCLU dataset (right).
%
For CORELS (thin lines) with the ProPublica recidivism dataset (left),
the objective drops quickly, achieving the optimal value within 10 seconds.
CORELS certifies optimality in less than 6 minutes --
the objective lower bound steadily converges to the optimal objective (top)
as the search space shrinks (bottom).
%
We dynamically and incrementally
calculate~$\lfloor \log_{10} \Remaining(\CurrentObj, \Queue) \rfloor$,
where~$\Remaining(\CurrentObj, \Queue)$
is the upper bound~\eqref{eq:remaining} on remaining search space size
(Theorem~\ref{thm:remaining-eval-fine});
this adds some computational overhead.
%
In the same plots (left), we additionally highlight
a separate execution of CORELS without the equivalent points bound
(Theorem~\ref{thm:identical}) (thick lines).
%
After nearly 3 hours, the execution is still far from complete;
in particular, the lower bound is far from the optimum objective value (top)
and much of the search space remains unexplored (bottom).
%
For the NYCLU stop-and-frisk dataset (right),
CORELS achieves the optimum objective in well under a second,
and certifies optimality in less than a minute.
%
CORELS without the permutation bound (Corollary~\ref{thm:permutation}),
and thus the symmetry-aware map,
requires orders of magnitude more time to complete (thick lines).

CORELS quickly achieves the optimal value (star markers),
and certifies optimality when the lower bound matches the objective value.

On the left, a separate and significantly longer execution of CORELS
without the equivalent points  (Theorem~\ref{thm:identical}) bound remains
far from complete, and its lower bound (thick solid line) far from the optimum.
%
On the right, a separate execution of CORELS without the permutation bound
(Corollary~\ref{thm:permutation}), and thus the symmetry-aware map,
requires orders of magnitude more time to complete.
%
Bottom: $\lfloor \log_{10} \Remaining(\CurrentObj, \Queue) \rfloor$,
as a function of wall clock time (log scale),

(Theorem~\ref{thm:remaining-eval-fine}).
%
For these problems, the equivalent points (left) and
permutation (right) bounds are responsible for the ability of
CORELS to quickly eliminate most of the search space (thin solid lines);
the remaining search space decays much more slowly without these bounds (thick solid lines).

\subsection{Algorithmic Speedup}
%TODO Remove calculation
We calculate the overall speed-up of CORELS compared to a naive implementation and determine the feasibility of running
our algorithm 30 years ago.
%
On the COMPAS dataset, where the number of rules is $M = 156$, naively evaluating all prefixes of up to length 5 would
require examining $8.7 \times 10^{10}$ different prefixes.
%
However, while CORELS only examines prefixes up to length 5 in order to certify optimality, a naive implementation 
would have to look at even longer prefixes. 
%
Without our equivalent points bound, but with all of our other optimizations, we evaluate prefixes up to at least length 10 (see 
Table~\ref{tab:ablation} and Figure~\ref{fig:queue})---thus a naive algorithm would have to evaluate prefixes of length 10 or longer.
%
Naively evaluating all prefixes up to length 10 would require looking at $6.4 \times 10^{21}$ different prefixes.
%
However, CORELS examines only 180 million prefixes in total---a reduction of $3.5 \times 10^{13}$.
%
It takes us about 2$\mu$s to evaluate a single prefix (given by dividing the number of lower bound evaluations by the total time
in Table~\ref{tab:ablation}).
%
A naive solution would take $1.54 \times 10^8$ seconds---about 5 years---while CORELS takes only 2 minutes.
%
It is clear that brute force would not scale to larger problems.
%

We compare our current computing circumstances to those of 1984, the year when CART was published.
%
Moore's law holds that computing power doubled every 18 months from 1984-2006.
%
This is a period of 264 months, which means computing power has gone up by at least a factor of $32,000$ since 1984.
%
Thus, even with our algorithmic and data structural improvements, CORELS would have run in over 3,600,000s in 1984---an unreasonable amount of time.
%
Our advances are meaningful only because we can run them on a modern system.
%
Combining our algorithmic improvements with the increase in modern processor speeds, our algorithm runs more than $10^{18}$ times faster than a naive implementation would have in 1984.
%
This helps explain why our algorithm, nor other branch-and-bound variants, had not been developed before now.
